# IPL-Data-Visualization-and-Player-Statistics-Analysis

The goal of this project was to visualize and analyze IPL (Indian Premier League) data, providing insights into the relationships between various variables. Additionally, functions were created to display batting and bowling statistics for any player throughout the history of IPL.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Seaborn

## Project Overview

1. Data Exploration: IPL data were explored using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to understand the dataset's structure, uncover patterns, and identify potential trends.
2. Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries were utilized to create visually informative charts, graphs, and plots, illustrating the relationships between different variables and showcasing IPL trends.
3. Batting Statistics: Custom functions were developed to display comprehensive batting statistics for any player participating in the IPL. Users can input a player's name, and the program generates their batting performance data.
4. Bowling Statistics: Similarly, functions were implemented to showcase detailed bowling statistics for any IPL player. By providing a player's name, users can access their bowling performance data.

## Usage 

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn) if not already installed.
3. Run the Python script containing the IPL Data Visualization and Analysis functions.
4. Explore IPL data trends and relationships using the provided visualizations.
5. Obtain batting and bowling statistics for any IPL player by inputting their name.
